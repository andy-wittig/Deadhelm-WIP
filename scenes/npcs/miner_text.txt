Well hey there, stranger...
Mah names Adam -- and you must be the devil himself!
Hahaha! I'm just kidding. Nice horns, kid.
Anyway, glad to see a new face in town. Its been ages since anything in this dusty ol' place has changed.
Tell yah what kid? Mah cats gone missing for a few days, do me a favor and find him, and I'll help you out with some cash to spend over at the town market.
Hey kid, I appreciate it. He's the fat orange cat, answers to "Kitty".
